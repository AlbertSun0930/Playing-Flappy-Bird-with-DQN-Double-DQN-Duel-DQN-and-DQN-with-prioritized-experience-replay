In this project we adopt the original DQN code from [cite](https://github.com/hardlyrichie/pytorch-flappy-bird). We use cuda to achieve much faster convergence.   We also implement 4 algorithms combined with DQN by ourselves, i.e, double-DQN, prioritized experience replay, dueling network architecture and integration of them.  

To get models to start training run:
--------------------------------
```
python DQN.py train
python PriDQN.py train
python DoubleDQN.py train
python DuelDQN.py train
python PriDoubleDuelDQN.py train
```

To test models:

We have save neural network parameters of the PriDoubleDuelDQN model. You can test it by runing:  
```
python PriDoubleDuelDQN.py test
```

For others, you need to train the models first and get convergence. Then you can run the following codes for testing:
```
python PriDQN.py test
python DoubleDQN.py test
python DuelDQN.py test
python DQN.py test
```
