# Playing-Flappy-Bird-with-Deep-Q-Network-and-Other-Improvement
In this project we adopt the original DQN code from [cite](https://github.com/hardlyrichie/pytorch-flappy-bird). We use cuda to achieve much faster convergence.   We also implement 4 algorithms combined with DQN by ourselves, i.e, double-DQN, prioritized experience replay, dueling network architecture and integration of them.
